This is a modified version of [High Performance Linpack](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/), intended to be used
on top [Simgrid/SMPI](https://simgrid.org/) simulator. It was used in the following articles:
- [Predicting the Energy Consumption of MPI Applications at Scale Using a Single Node](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01523608)
- [Fast and Faithful Performance Prediction of MPI Applications: the HPL Case Study](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02096571)
